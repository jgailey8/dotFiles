# Step 1:
# When you get following options during svn merge command, select option 'l'. This is to launch external tool to resolve conflicts.
#
# Conflict discovered in 'main.h'.
# Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
#        (mc) mine-conflict, (tc) theirs-conflict,
#        (s) show all options: l

# Step 3:
# Now below options will appear again, select 'r' (to accept the merged version) now.
